                my name is jordan damrau and i'm a computer science student currently studying at st joseph's university. 
                i am 22 years old and have two amazing siblings (and four crazy dogs). 
                one of my hobbies is building computers and customizing different builds with my imaginary money.
                i love coding difficult programs, specifically websites and video games. 
                i have worked on various projects in school ranging from a simple calculator app to things like a large scale school management system or a souls-like video game. 
                i'm looking to persue a career in frontend web dev or software engineering.
            </p>

                i know the ins and outs of java and html/css. 
                i know c#, javascript, and python fairly well, but i am still working on learning some of the skills involved with those languages. 
                along with this, i love projects involving a team that is as hardworking as i am. 
                when i work, i tend to go above and beyond when coding my own projects to get the most out of learning. 
                along with that, i like to communicate my ideas and critiques into certain problems and solutions. 
                other applications that i have worked with are adobe photoshop and illustrator, unreal engine 4, unity engine, visual studio and visual studio code, 
                xcode, rstudio, and eclipse.
