        <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%;">
            my name is jordan damrau and i'm a computer science student currently studying at st joseph's university. 
            i am 22 years old and have two amazing siblings (and four crazy dogs). 
            one of my hobbies is building computers and customizing different builds with my imaginary money.
            i love coding difficult programs, specifically websites and video games. 
            i have worked on various projects in school ranging from a simple calculator app to things like a large scale school management system or a souls-like video game. 
            i'm looking to persue a career in front end web dev or software engineering.

            i know the ins and outs of java and html/css. 
            i know c#, javascript, and python fairly well, but i am still working on learning some of the skills involved with those languages. 
            along with this, i love projects involving a team that is as hardworking as i am. 
            when i work, i tend to go above and beyond when coding my own projects to get the most out of learning. 
            along with that, i like to communicate my ideas and critiques into certain problems and solutions. 
            other languages i have worked with are

            my task for this project was to create a program that stored students, faculty, classrooms and buildings in a file and be able to write 
            from that file using my knowledge of object-oriented programming and javafx.

            a team of me and three other people created a video game with the theme of traversing through the nine circles of hell (Dante's Inferno). 
            with many advanced fighting mechanics, npc's, mini bosses and a final boss, the game created an intense and suspenseful experience for the user. 
            although unfinished, a demo of the first level was created showcasing many different aspects of the game.
